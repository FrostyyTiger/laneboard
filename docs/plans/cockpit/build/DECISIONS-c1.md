# Cockpit build: decisions of the C1 night(s)

Choices a builder had to make that the spec (`docs/plans/cockpit/spec/`) does not cover. The spec's own
decisions stay in `spec/DECISIONS.md` (`D<n>`); these are `B<n>`, one line each:
`B<n> <choice> — because <why> — spec: <file §> — overrule: <what changes>`. Small and reversible only;
taste, one-way or security-relevant choices go to `build/PROGRESS.md` `## For the owner` instead.

## Decisions

- B0 (set up with the loop, not by a round) Board changes in fenced files are written as patches in
  `build/patches/`, never committed by a round; until the hub patch of `slices.md` §5.1 is applied,
  `runs` on a hub answers `Runs are not available on this hub yet.` and S-C3-03 runs against a single
  board — because the hub and the security core stay reviewed (`loop-build/fenced.txt`) — spec:
  `slices.md` §5.1 — overrule: unfence `server/hub/read-proxy.mjs` and `server/hub/routes/` for the night.
- B00 (set up with the loop, not by a round) The Wall's galaxy answers `show.result` `skipped` with three
  `why` values besides `in use`: `unsupported` (`compare`, `scrub` until the Show and History slices),
  `not drawn` (the node is not on this galaxy) and `bad-args`; the room's message checks accept all four
  — because the Wall merge built them (`docs/wall.md` "Show commands") — spec: `protocols.md` §4
  — overrule: map them onto `in use` in the room and keep the spec's single value.
